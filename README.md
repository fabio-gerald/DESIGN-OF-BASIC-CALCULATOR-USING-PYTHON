#### **Core Features**

 **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Percentages and square roots.

**Unit Conversions**
   - Length, weight, volume, temperature, and time.
   - Customizable units and conversion factors.
 **History and Tape**
   - Persistent calculation history with options to review and reuse past calculations.
   - Option to export calculation history to a text or CSV file.

#### **Technical Specifications**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Core Libraries:**
  - `math` for mathematical functions.
  - `numpy` for scientific computations and statistical analysis.
  - `decimal` for precise arithmetic operations.

#### **Design Components**

1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
   - Simple text-based interface for executing commands.
   - User inputs arithmetic or scientific expressions directly.
   - Output is displayed immediately with calculation results.

   ```

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - **Design:**
     - User-friendly layout with buttons for each function.
     - Display area for the current expression and result.
     - History panel to view and reuse past calculations.

   - **Libraries:**
     - `tkinter`: Lightweight and built-in GUI library.
     - `PyQt`: More advanced GUI toolkit if additional features are needed.

   **Example GUI Components:**
   - **Display Area:** Shows current input and result.
   - **Buttons:** Organized into rows for digits, operations, and functions.
   - **History Panel:** Accessible history of previous calculations.

3. **Advanced Features**
   - **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of invalid inputs and calculations.
   - **Extensibility:** Easy to add new functions and features.
   - **Configuration File:** Option to customize settings and preferences.

4. **Unit Tests and Debugging**
   - **Testing Framework:** Use `unittest` or `pytest` to ensure functionality and stability.
   - **Debugging:** Comprehensive logging for tracking issues and performance.
